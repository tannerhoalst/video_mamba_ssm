\captionof{figure}{Left: Our model can generate consistent depth predictions for long videos with rich actions. The demo video shows a 196-second (4690 frames) long take of pair skating, as sourced from~\cite{huang2024wildavatar}. Right: Comparison to baselines in terms of accuracy ($\delta_1$), consistency, and latency on the Nvidia A100 GPU (denoted with circle size). Consistency is defined as the maximum \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{E}rror (TAE) among all models minus the TAE of each individual model. Our model achieves the best performance in all aspects.}
