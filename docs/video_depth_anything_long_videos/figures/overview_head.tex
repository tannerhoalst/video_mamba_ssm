   \caption{\textbf{Overall pipeline and the spatio-temporal head}. Left: Our model is composed of a backbone encoder from Depth Anything V2 and a newly proposed spatio-temporal head. We jointly train our model on video data using ground-truth depth labels for supervision and on unlabeled images with pseudo labels generated by a teacher model. During training, only the head is learned. Right: Our spatiotemporal head inserts several temporal layers into the DPT head, while preserving the original structure of DPT head~\cite{ranftl2021vision}.
